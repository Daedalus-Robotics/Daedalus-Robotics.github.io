Our competitions thusfar have been graciously funded by the Stem Student Leadership Association ([SSLA](https://stemstudentleader.weebly.com/)), a 501C3 non-profit organization. Their main purpose is to provide funds for tools or materials that are needed for projects that students are passionate about. SSLA tries to encourage STEM throughout other communities by holding community events that are STEM related. These events are open to all children that are interested in STEM.
